This project is built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB to create a platform where users can buy and sell products with payment integration. The app lets users create accounts, list items for sale, browse available products, add items to a shopping cart, and make secure payments.

The backend uses Node.js and Express for the server, and MongoDB with Mongoose for the database, ensuring efficient data handling and validation. Key features include user authentication, product management, shopping cart functionality, and secure payment processing.

To make it easier for developers to use the API, we have included Swagger documentation. Swagger provides clear information on how to use the API, with details on endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. It also offers an interactive UI for testing the API.

Overall, this project combines essential web technologies to offer a user-friendly and secure e-commerce platform, making it easy to build and expand an online marketplace.
